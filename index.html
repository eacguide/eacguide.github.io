Current version as of this guide: EAC 1.0 beta 3.<br>

<font color="red">This guide was made for EAC version 1.0 beta 3 and 
will not completely work with earlier versions. Versions 0.99 or earlier
 should use the blowfish guide.</font><br>
<br>
<b>Anything with a green outline around it is a required setting. 
Anything orange is required but depends on your drive. Anything unmarked
 is optional.</b><br>

<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="4">Step 1: Download and install EAC</font></b><br>
Download the installer and fire it up.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac01.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Eventually you'll get to a screen like this. Make sure you install 
AccurateRip, CDRDAO, CTDB, and freedb as a bare minimum. FLAC will be 
useful as well if you don't have it separately installed. GD3 is only 
useful if you want to pay for metadata results. I assume you don't.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="4">Step 2: Start EAC</font></b><br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac02.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
When you first start EAC, you'll see a screen like this one. Hit 
"Cancel". Next, put a popular CD into your drive, preferably not one 
that was recently released (a few months old at least). You'll see a 
window like the one below appear. If you have an older version of EAC or
 dBpoweramp installed, it's likely AccurateRip was already configured, 
and this may not appear.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac03.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Hit Configure. It may take a few minutes. Hit "Ok" afterward. Once 
again, if you have an older version of EAC or dBpoweramp installed, it's
 likely AccurateRip was already configured, and this may not appear.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="4">Step 3: EAC Options</font></b><br>
All of the options dialogs can be found from the EAC menu at the top of the screen. <br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac04.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Start with EAC Options. Any tabs not pictured are completely optional settings, or are irrelevant to ripping.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac05.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Make sure you set the green highlighted settings as shown. If you're 
using an older version of EAC, make sure "No use of null samples for CRC
 calculations is <b>UNCHECKED</b>. The rest is optional, choose as you will. Locking the drive tray during extraction isn't a bad idea though.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac06.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
These settings are pretty much all optional and self explanatory. I'd 
recommend using Alternate CD play routines and disabling autostart 
though.<br>
<br>
The "Create log files always in english language" is <b>very</b> 
important for our international users. This will let you keep EAC's 
language as your native one, but write the log file in English, allowing
 it to pass our logchecker without needing to be rescored manually.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac07.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
If your drive is capable of reading UPC/ISRC codes and CD-Text (you can 
only really figure this out by trial and error), you're welcome to keep 
the top two options checked. Otherwise, uncheck them.<br>
<br>
Other than that, these settings are pretty much ideal. I wouldn't 
recommend using more than 1 compressor thread even if you have a 
multicore computer. It doesn't take very long compared to the track 
extraction anyway. Note that in tests run by punkmeup, disabling the 
queue of external compressors in the background fixed an issue where EAC
 was generating WAV files instead of FLAC, so I've made that a required 
option. It should have no bearing on the rip quality. If rip queueing 
works for you (it does for me), feel free to leave it enabled.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac08.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Friends don't let friends normalize their EAC rips. Don't ever do it. It will instantly be given a 0% by the logchecker.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac09.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
This is the proper way to name tracks. The only difference acceptable here would be perhaps <b>%tracknr2%. %title%</b>
 if you prefer periods instead of dashes in the filenames. If you need 
track numbers to go into triple digits for some reason, use %tracknr3% 
instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Naming Convention</b> : %tracknr2% - %title%<br>
<br>
Check '<b>Use Various Artists Naming Scheme</b>' and use : %tracknr2% - %artist% - %title%<br>
<br>
Don't replace spaces by underscores. It looks ridiculous.<br>
<br>
			A note on directory naming schemes: Don't use a directory structure 
here, unless you want to go back and edit your CUE sheet later. When you
 add a directory to the naming scheme, it'll put that directory path 
into the files. Then when someone goes to burn the files in EAC using 
your cuesheet, they'll be unable to do so. If you do insist on using a 
directory structure here, you need to go back, edit the CUE in a program
 such as notepad, and remove the folder name from each line.<br>
<br>
For example, a cuesheet line should look like this:<br>
<br>
FILE "01 Last Known Surroundings.wav" WAVE<br>
<br>
Not like this: <br>
<br>
FILE "C:\EAC Rips\Explosions in the Sky - Take Care, Take Care, Take Care (2011) [FLAC]\01 Last Known Surroundings.wav" WAVE

<b><font size="4">Step 4: Drive Options</font></b><br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac10.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Start by hitting "Detect Read Features...". This will actually take a 
few minutes. The only feature detection that actually matters is 
Accurate Stream. If your drive can use it, checkmark the setting (most 
modern drives have Accurate Stream). If it can't, don't.<br>
<br>
Even if your drive doesn't cache audio, just do us a favour and leave 
that checked. Not only will it stop you from having to have each of your
 uploads rescored by hand, but it doesn't affect the audio quality at 
all. Yes, the rips take a bit longer with that setting enabled. Go watch
 TV or something while you wait.<br>
<br>
Do not use C2, even if EAC thinks you can. Most drives have terrible C2 error implementation.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac11.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Hit "Autodetect read command now". It shouldn't take long. Leave 
everything else unchecked unless you're having problems. You can 
checkmark "CD-Text Read capable drive" if you want to test whether your 
drive can do it. If it can, great, otherwise, uncheck it. It's unlikely 
you'll ever use that feature anyway.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac12.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
If you did the AccurateRip configuration at the start of this guide, the
 top half here will be greyed out. If not, you'll need to find your read
 offset correction from <a href="http://accuraterip.com/driveoffsets.htm" target="_blank">this list</a>. Don't use a combined read/write offset.<br>
<br>
If you want to figure out whether your drive needs "Overread into 
Lead-in and Lead-Out" checked, you can check by temporarily unchecking 
"Use AccurateRip with this drive". Stick a CD in the drive and hit 
"Detect read sample offset correction...". If you're just doing this for
 the Overread, see below:<br>
<br>
<div class="bbcode_container">

positive ,or if it says Lead-In and your offset correction is negative. 
Otherwise disable (uncheck) it.</div>
			
		</div>
	</div>
</div>Remember to check "Use AccurateRip with this drive" again once you're finished. AccurateRip is always a good idea.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac13.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Pretty much every drive should work with the settings shown. If yours 
stalls on detecting gaps or detects gaps that are obviously wrong (like 
30 second gaps on a non-live album), try Detection method B or C. If A, 
B, and C all fail, you can switch "Secure" to "Accurate" and try again.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b><font size="4">Step 5: Metadata Options</font></b><br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac14.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Here's where you pick your metadata provider. If you did install GD3, 
it'll be in the list. You can only rip 10 discs before you have to pay 
for a subscription though. Otherwise, you have a choice between the 
MusicBrainz plugin (CTDB), freedb plugin and EAC's native freedb 
support. I'm not really sure what the big difference is, I'm guessing 
it's the cover+lyrics. Anyway, change those settings above if you wish.<br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac15.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
If you use EAC's native freedb instead, the settings should look like 
this. Make sure you put an email at the top, it doesn't need to be real.
 Hit "Get active freedb server list". Then checkmark the last option.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="4">Step 6: Compression Options</font></b><br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac16.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Set up this tab exactly as shown. You'll have to browse to the path 
where you have flac.exe, if you installed it with EAC it's in C:\Program
 Files (x86)\Exact Audio Copy\FLAC\flac.exe. If you installed it 
separately it's wherever you installed it. The bitrate and high/low 
quality have no effect on the rip.<br>
<br>
The commandline parameters have changed in this version, so this will 
look new to most of you. The commandline recommended for optimal 
completeness is this:<br>
<br>
<b>-8 -V -T "ARTIST=%artist%" -T "TITLE=%title%" -T "ALBUM=%albumtitle%"
 -T "DATE=%year%" -T "TRACKNUMBER=%tracknr%" -T "GENRE=%genre%" -T 
"PERFORMER=%albuminterpret%" -T "COMPOSER=%composer%" 
%haslyrics%--tag-from-file=LYRICS="%lyricsfile%"%haslyrics% -T 
"ALBUMARTIST=%albumartist%" -T "DISCNUMBER=%cdnumber%" -T 
"TOTALDISCS=%totalcds%" -T "TOTALTRACKS=%numtracks%" -T 
"COMMENT=%comment%" %source% -o %dest%</b><br>
<br>
It takes no extra effort on your part, just copy and paste that into the additional commandline options and you're done.<br>
<br>
Note: the %comment% function is broken in version 1.0b2 (it returns the track CRC). Use something like <b>-T "COMMENT=EAC V1.0 beta 2, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC -8"</b> instead.<br>
<br>
Also, as of Beta 3 you may use the %tracknr1% variable instead of 
%tracknr% if you would like to have no leading zeroes in the track 
number field (like XLD does). tracknr1 will use, for example, '1' 
instead of '01'. <br>

			A note on the FLAC commandline in versions prior to 1.0b3: If you're using EAC 1.0b1, use the following commandline for FLAC:<br>
<b>-8 -V -T "ARTIST=%a" -T "TITLE=%t" -T "ALBUM=%g" -T "DATE=%y" -T 
"TRACKNUMBER=%n" -T "TOTALTRACKS=%x" -T "GENRE=%m" -T "ALBUMARTIST=%v" 
-T "COMMENT=EAC V1.0 beta 1, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, 
FLAC -8" %s</b><br>
<br>
Anything older than that, just change the version number in the tags.

			A note on ripping to lossy formats like MP3: So first off, this is a 
complete waste of time. In most cases, EAC is overkill for lossy files, 
and takes far too long to rip the CD to be practical. If your goal is to
 upload tracks here, your best bet is to rip once to FLAC and then use a
 program like dBpoweramp to convert that rip to the other formats. Even 
if you don't need a FLAC (one already exists on site, or this is for 
your personal collection only), it'll still be much faster to rip using 
any other program, and won't produce an audibly different result unless 
your CD has skips and bad scratches.<br>
<br>
However, the MP3 and Ogg command lines are included below. You'll need 
to browse to LAME.exe or oggenc2.exe, and set the extension to .mp3 or 
.ogg, respectively. The other settings remain the same, bitrate is still
 irrelevant.<br>
<br>
<b>V0 MP3:</b><br>
-V 0 --vbr-new --add-id3v2 --ignore-tag-errors --ta "%artist%" --tt 
"%title%" --tg "%genre%" --tl "%albumtitle%" --ty "%year%" --tn 
"%tracknr%" %source% -o %dest%<br>
<br>
<b>V2 MP3:</b><br>
-V 2 --vbr-new --add-id3v2 --ignore-tag-errors --ta "%artist%" --tt 
"%title%" --tg "%genre%" --tl "%albumtitle%" --ty "%year%" --tn 
"%tracknr%" %source% -o %dest%<br>
<br>
<b>320 kbps MP3:</b><br>
-b 320 -h --add-id3v2 --ignore-tag-errors --ta "%artist%" --tt "%title%"
 --tg "%genre%" --tl "%albumtitle%" --ty "%year%" --tn "%tracknr%" 
%source% -o %dest%<br>
<br>
<b>q8 Ogg:</b><br>
-q 8 -a "%artist%" -t "%title%" -l "%albumtitle%" -d "%year%" -N "%tracknr%" -G "%genre%" %source% -o %dest%
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac17.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Leave everything unchecked except the last option.<br>
<br>
Congrats! EAC is now properly set up! You may wish to save your settings
 in a profile by hitting "New" at the bottom of the screen. However, 
unless you're changing your settings frequently there's no need, EAC 
will remember all of this on next launch regardless.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="4">Step 7: Tagging</font></b><br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac18.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
So now let's look at the main window. Be sure everything is named 
correctly here, as these will be the tags on your ripped files. If 
you're ripping a classical CD, you may wish to fill in the 
Composer/Performer fields.<br>
<br>
Drag a cover image into the EAC window. I think ~500x500 is a decent size in most cases. Google images is your friend here.<br>
<br>
If you're ripping a box set, you may wish to use the options under the cover image, otherwise leave them all as "1".<br>
<br>
Finally, if you want to add lyrics to the tracks, use the "Lyrics" button.<br>
<br>
Note: I've also highlighted the "New" button where you can save your settings. This is not a necessary step each time you rip.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="4">Step 8: Gap Detection and Cuesheets</font></b><br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac19.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
The pre-rip stuff happens here. Make sure "Append Gaps to Previous Track
 (default)" is checked. It should be. Next, hit the options in the order
 shown. <br>
<br>
<b>First, hit "Detect Gaps". This is very important, your rip will fail the logchecker if you do not complete this step.</b> If the first track is highlighted in <font color="red">red</font>, you have a hidden track. You'll want to look at <a href="http://blowfish.be/eac/Rip/rip11-hidden.html" target="_blank">this</a> section of the blowfish.be guide.<br>
<br>
Next, go to Create CUE Sheet -&gt; Multiple WAV Files With Gaps... 
(Noncompliant). This is usually where I create the folder for ripping as
 well. <b>Do NOT rip your tracks to any directory containing your name. 
You should NEVER edit a log for any reason, especially now that we have 
checksums. A simple C:\EAC Rips is fine.</b><br>
<br>
I name my directories as follows:<br>
Artist - Album (Year) [Format] {Extra}<br>
<br>
So for example, with the album in the screenshots, it'd be<br>
<br>
Sam Roberts Band - Collider (2011) [FLAC] {UMC 0252764577}<br>
<br>
However, as long as it contains the album name and no nested folders (don't do \Artist\Album\), you're fine by the rules here.<br>
<br>
Anyway, make the folder, save the .cue file into it. I usually just name mine Noncompliant.cue, it doesn't really matter.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="4">Step 9: Ripping</font></b><br>
<br>
<img src="img/eac20.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
Finally, the rip itself! Make sure all the tracks are checkmarked in the
 main window unless there are some you don't want to rip.<br>
<br>
Test &amp; Copy -&gt; Compressed.<br>
<br>
Depending on your drive and whether or not the CD is scratched, this 
could take anywhere from ten minutes to four hours. Be patient.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="4">Step 10: Post-Rip</font></b><br>
<br>
So you're done! You may wish to use a logchecker to check and make sure 
your rip is proper, but if you followed this guide, the only possible 
errors would be with the CD itself. It does happen... some CDs are too 
badly damaged, even for EAC. Your best bet is to clean the CD and try 
again.<br>
<br>
Other than that, it never hurts to make sure your files are tagged and 
named properly (though they should be). Any extra stuff you want to 
include should be added now as well... Additional artwork, an md5 
fingerprint, an info.txt file, that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="4">Appendix A: CueTools Plugin (Optional)</font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font color="red">This is now installed by selecting "CTDB" in the 
EAC 1.0b3 options. Therefore, this will only be necessary for EAC 1.0b1 
and 1.0b2, or if you want to update the plugin by hand to a newer 
version.</font></b><br>
<br>
Starting with version 1.0b1, EAC now supports plugins! While they've so 
far been few and far between, the CueTools plugin is quite handy. Not 
only does it give you a second opinion past the AccurateRip database and
 include the CueTools hash in the log, but it also gives you an option 
to get metadata from MusicBrainz if you prefer it to freedb.<br>
<br>
Download page:<br>
<a href="http://cuetools.net/wiki/CTDB_EAC_Plugin" target="_blank">http://cuetools.net/wiki/CTDB_EAC_Plugin</a><br>
<br>
Installation: Extract the files to EAC's root directory (containing 
EAC.exe). Usually this is located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Exact Audio 
Copy. <br>
<br>
Usage: None, it works automatically. You can check whether it's 
installed under EAC Options-&gt;Audio Plugins. If you wish to use 
MusicBrainz, go to Metadata Options and select "CUETools DB Metadata 
Plugin" from the list.
